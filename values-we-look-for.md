Things we value in our people

People with a sense of ownership.

We honor commitments to each other and our customers. We know our stuff, and if we don’t, we know that too. We ask questions to fully understand what’s required, step up to address issues, and lend a hand where needed. But at the end of the day we answer for our own actions. We see things through.

People who sweat the small things.

We have high expectations and standards. We know that every choice, no matter how small, is a chance to reflect our values. But we don’t let it paralyze us.

People who want to explore everything.

We are curious, and embrace the uncertainty that comes with taking risks and opening ourselves up to new approaches and experiences. We’re not interested in how it’s always been done, we care more about the best way to do it. We are nimble, quick to react, and willing to change our minds. We take pride in our resourcefulness, and apply creative and original thought to every problem. Learning is our natural state; true understanding is our north star.

People who are human.

We treat people the way we want to be treated. We’re slow to judge. We have empathy and value our differences. We’re fair and consistent.

People who communicate openly.

We’re honest with each other and ourselves. (Direct feedback is a form of honesty. So is saying what you believe). This builds trust and encourages transparency, which allow us to feel safe. We provide context before jumping into the details.

People who are interesting.

We’re not afraid to be ourselves. We don’t take ourselves too seriously. We accept other people's quirkiness as much as our own.
