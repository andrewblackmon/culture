**Budgets**

Our budgets are created to help guide us to where we want to go, but we can’t predict the future, and we constantly listen and adjust our budgets as strategies evolve. Our teams make quarterly predictions for the year and include expenses of large purchases such as softwares, materials, contracts, building leases, etc in their budgets. These budgets are used as an outline and can be improved at any point. When budgets are created and updated, we seek consultation and input from our team members who are impacted by these decisions.

**Expenses**

The Company doesn’t establish specific limitations on expenses, but rather, expects that every team member will incur only reasonable expenses, that are in the best interest of the Company. Use your common sense when spending TBTs money. Remember that we’re a startup that’s not yet profitable, and we need to be scrappy everyday. A key question to ask when spending money is, "how would you spend this if it were your own money?"

Also, part of the benefit of working at TBT is that you gain shares and have part ownership in the company. When the company does well, you will do well. When you overspend the company’s money, you’re hurting the profitability of the company, and therefore your own personal profit. 

Please don't hesitate to ask if you're ever unsure if an expense is within reason.

**Reimbursement process**

To streamline our employee reimbursement process, we use Expensify to submit our company related expenses for reimbursement. Expense reports can be submitted on a weekly or monthly basis. In order to create a culture of mutual trust, we ask that you attached receipts to all of your expense reports. Technically, the IRS only requires receipts for any expenses over $75 dollars, so if you do lose a receipt, we’ll ask you to complete a lost receipt form for the expense. A few last details: expenses should be submitted within 60 days of the expense, and after your report is submitted, you will receive a direct deposit within 7-10 business days.

In support of our culture of trust, we do not require approval of company related expenses. We expect everyone on the team to use good judgement and understand what expenses are reasonable and reimbursable. For check and balance purposes, we will give Department heads access to their team members expense reports in case they ever need to take a look at a particular expense. 

**Travel expenses**

Again, we don’t have specific limitations on expenses, just use your best judgement and spend smartly. 

When you’re traveling for work, book seats in the coach/economy section. If you book Business or First class, you’ll be asked to pay the difference between Coach and the higher fare you’ve chosen.

Be reasonable with your hotel choice. We don't provide reimbursement for five star experiences, but we also don't want you to stay in a Motel 6. In most cities $200 should be enough but we understand that in certain times of the year you may have to go above that.

Be reasonable with your meal expenses too. We don't provide reimbursement for meals from expensive restaurants, but we also don't want you to eat at McDonalds. In most cities $30 per meal for 3 meals per day is enough, but we understand that at certain times your dinner bill may be more expensive.  

For transportation, use taxis, bus services, and public transportation where possible.If you do choose to rent a vehicle, don’t rent a luxury vehicle. Also, you do not select LDW (Loss Damage Waiver) or CDW (Collision Damage Waiver), as you’re covered under TBTs insurance policy.

**Company Credit Cards**
 
We issue department managers corporate credit cards for their business related expenses. These cards are to be used with discretion and should only be used for business necessities. We don't have specific limitations for expenses, but we expect everyone to only incur reasonable expenses that are in the best interest of the company. 

To help us manage our expenses, we use Expensify as a way to reconcile and capture our expenses at the end of each month. If you have a corporate card, you’ll receive an email at the end of each month from Expensify with all of your company expenses included in the report. Please review this report, attach detailed receipts and include comments to any expenses that are not self explanatory. Also, receipts are required for any expenses that exceed $75. Once the report looks accurate, just click "submit".
