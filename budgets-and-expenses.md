**Budgets**

Our budgets are created to help guide us to where we want to go, but we can’t predict the future, and we constantly listen and adjust our budgets as strategies evolve. Our teams make quarterly predictions for the year and include expenses of large purchases such as softwares, materials, contracts, building leases, etc in their budgets. These budgets are used as an outline and can be improved at any point. When budgets are created and updated, we seek consultation and input from our team members who are impacted by these decisions.

**Expenses**

The Company doesn’t establish specific limitations on expenses, but rather, expects that every team member will incur only reasonable expenses, that are in the best interest of the Company. Use your common sense when spending TBTs money. Remember that we’re a startup that’s not yet profitable, and we need to be scrappy everyday. A key question to ask when spending money is, "how would you spend this if it were your own money?"

Also, part of the benefit of working at TBT is that you gain shares and have part ownership in the company. When the company does well, you will do well. When you overspend the company’s money, you’re hurting the profitability of the company, and therefore your own personal profit. 

Please don't hesitate to ask if you're ever unsure if an expense is within reason.

**Reimbursement process**

To streamline our employee reimbursement process, we use Expensify to submit our company related expenses for reimbursement. Expense reports can be submitted on a weekly or monthly basis. In order to create a culture of mutual trust, we ask that you attach receipts to all of your expense reports. Technically, the IRS only requires receipts for any expenses over $75 dollars, so if you do lose a receipt, we’ll ask you to complete a lost receipt form for the expense. A few last details: expenses should be submitted within 60 days of the expense, and after your report is submitted, you will receive a direct deposit within 7-10 business days.

We do not require approval of company related expenses. We expect everyone on the team to use good judgement and understand what expenses are reasonable and reimbursable. For check and balance purposes, we will give managers access to their team members expense reports in case they ever need to take a look at a particular expense. 

**Travel expenses**

Again, we don’t have specific limitations on expenses, just use your best judgement and spend smartly. If you're ever unsure of what's reasonable, check out the Playbook for some guidance.
