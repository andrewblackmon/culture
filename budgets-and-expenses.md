**Budgets and Expenses**

Our budgets are created to help guide us to where we want to go, but we canâ€™t predict the future, and we constantly listen and adjust our budgets as strategies evolve. Our teams make quarterly predictions for the year and include expenses of large purchases such as softwares, materials, contracts, building leases, etc in their budgets. These budgets are used as an outline and can be improved at any point. When budgets are created and updated, we seek consultation and input from our team members who are impacted by these decisions. 

To streamline our employee reimbursement process, we use Expensify to submit our company related expenses for reimbursement once a month. All expenses and receipts must be attached to expense reports. We ask that all expenses be submitted within 60 days of the expense. After your report is submitted, you will receive a direct deposit within 7-10 business days. 

In support of our culture of trust, we do not require approval of company related expenses. We expect everyone on the team to have good judgement and understand what expenses are reasonable and reimbursable. In addition, to foster more transparency of company related expenses, we make all expense reports open and viewable for anyone in the company to see.
