Freedom and ownership 

We have an understanding that as you’re given more freedom, you remain equally accountable for your actions.

In support of our culture of trust, and in order for us all to make the best possible decisions for the company, we share sensitive and unfiltered information with everyone in the company. We can all view each other’s expense reports, budgets, and KPIs. We trust everyone to deal with and be in support of the good and bad news. When we have questions or concerns about the data and information being shared, we ask the  accountable experts in the company to avoid misinterpretation and distortion of information. 

Our culture is not built on fear or suspicion, so there is no need to hide any “bad results” from one another. We all make mistakes, and we expect everyone to own up to these mistakes and find solutions to improve the situation. This approach forces us to grow and face  reality. 

Budgets and Expenses

Our budgets are created to help guide us to where we want to go, but we can’t predict the future, and we constantly listen and adjust our budgets as strategies evolve. Our teams make rough quarterly predictions for the year and include expenses of large purchases such as softwares, materials, contracts, building leases, etc in their budgets. These budgets are used as an outline and can be improved at any point. When budgets are created and updated, we seek consultation and input from our team members who are impacted by these decisions. 

To streamline our employee reimbursement process, we use Expensify to submit our company related expenses for reimbursement once a month. All expenses and receipts must be attached to expense reports. We ask that all expenses be submitted within 60 days of the expense. After your report is submitted, you will receive a direct deposit within 7-10 business days. 

In support of our culture of trust, we do not require approval of company related expenses. We expect everyone on the team to have good judgement and understand what expenses are reasonable and reimbursable. In addition, to foster more transparency of company related expenses, we make all expense reports open and viewable for anyone in the company to see.  

Compensation

We pay market salary rate (50th percentile) for everyone’s role and level. Our compensation is decoupled from performance reviews, and we use market data to dictate increases, in order to ensure that we pay everyone fairly. 

We pull compensation data from a system called AdvancedHR, which uses public and private compensation data from all major companies in our industry. The data from AdvancedHR is reviewed once per year at the beginning of each calendar year. During this time, we adjust anyone who is being paid under market rate for their role and level. Anyone who was already at market rate is instead considered for an annual cost of living increase.
