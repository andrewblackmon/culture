We hold each other accountable in order to protect our culture. We are all responsible for our behaviors and actions, and we have no one to blame but ourselves if we’re not performing.  
 
There are of course the obvious ways to be let go (harrassment, intoxication, violence, attendance, illegal activities, failure to do job requirements, etc). One of the easiest ways to get kicked out of TBT, is if you’re making bad decisions without seeking advice from the right people. We don’t keep people with bad judgment. We don’t allow people to abuse TBTs freedoms and perks. We don’t keep people who don’t take initiative, are intolerant of change, abuse company money, show intolerance of others, are inflexible, participate in mean spirited gossip, breach company values, or who are constantly negative about the company.
