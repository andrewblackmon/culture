**Maternity and Paternity Leave**

If you’re becoming a new mom or dad, you better take some much needed time off to spend time with your family! TBT supports every full-time team member in doing this by allowing you to take up to six (6) weeks of paid time off to bond with your new baby. This means you can take off for the birth, adoption, and/or fostering of your new child.  

You’re not required to take the full six weeks to receive this benefit. We just ask that you take the time off within 12 months from the date of the birth or placement of your child, and that the time off is taken in at least 1 week increments. 

Before you take time off, contact the Talent & People Department to find out the details about the benefits available to you.

**401(k)** 

We provide a 401(k) plan through Betterment. Betterment is an easy to use online service that helps with fund allocation for your 401(k) investments. TBT covers the admin fees for everyone who participates in the plan. 

401(k)s are one of the best ways to save for your retirement. It’s only available through your employer, and it’s tax-advantaged and allows you to contribute pre-tax dollars to stocks and bonds. By saving money in a 401(k), your money will be able to grow tax-deferred, meaning the money you invest now will grow even faster. 

We auto enroll all employees to defer 3% of their salary per pay check. However, you can change your deferral amount, or decline to participate in the plan at anytime by accessing your online Betterment account. It will just take 1 pay cycle for the contribution change to take effect within payroll. 

Any money that is contributed into your Betterment account will remain in your 401(k) until you reach 59 1/2. If it is withdrawn before age 59 1/2, you will incur a withdrawal penalty. Money deposited into a 401(k) account can not be refunded by the Company into your pay check. Remember that TBT is offering this 401(k) plan as a perk to its employees because we want to help you save, and the Company, in no way, benefits from your contributions.

It has an annual contribution limit of $18,000 per year. There is an additional $6,000 catch-up contribution available if the employee is 50 or older 

**Perks** 

**Stock options**

We believe that our full-time team members deserve to receive a portion of ownership in the company. Part of the benefit of working at TBT is that you’re given stock options and have a stake in the company. When the company does well, you will do well.

**Friday lunch** 

Every Friday, we order lunch for the team from local restaurants. Send us your restaurant recommendations! We try to cater for all types of dietary restrictions. It’s provided to make us more efficient and unify the team. We encourage everyone to eat together in the common area, and to try to sit with new team members to get to know everyone in the company. We want everyone to learn what each other is working on, and who they are, on a personal level.

**Snacks and beverages**

We offer complimentary beverages and snacks so you won’t go hungry during the day, or have to make another trip to the store.

**Dry cleaning and tailoring** 

We offer dry cleaning and tailoring services to everyone on the team. By bringing it in-house, we hope to eliminate one less chore for you to worry about outside of work, help you save on costs, and help you take care of your clothes, so you feel your best!

We'll dry clean and tailor any of your casual clothing items, shirts, pants, jackets, blazers, suits, casual dresses, etc. We just won't be able to do this for your home goods, extravagant clothing, or your family and friend’s clothing items.

We know you'll use your best judgement here. 

**Paid parking**

Santa Monica is a crowded city, and parking in the area can be somewhat of nightmare. Almost all parking near our office locations is paid parking lots. For anyone on the team who's working out of the Santa Monica offices, you'll be reimbursed for your parking or LA public metro transportaion costs of up to a max of $10 per day. 

We hope this helps to make your commute and parking woes a little less painful. 

**Cell Phone Reimbursement**

We provide our regular full-time salaried team members a monthly cell phone reimbursement of up to $60 per month. We do this since we don't have desk phones, and we're frequently on our phones communicating with team members when we're outside of the office. 

We don't offer this reimbursement to everyone on the team, since there are certain roles that don't require as frequent communication once you're out of the office. Every role in the company has different job requirements, and depdending on your responsibilities, it may not be necessary for you to access your email or phone while outside of work.

**Employee Discounts**

We want you all to enjoy TBTs products and feel free to rent them whenever you like. If you're a full-time team member, then you can rent TBT apparel free of charge. You can rent for your significant others at no cost as well. 

You can share discounts with your friends & family as well. 

* 40% off for immediate family
* 20% off for friends: you have 10 of these to give out in total (including groomsmen)
* 10% off for anyone you like

 All orders should be placed at least 2 weeks in advance, and you'll need to pay the shipping costs for your order. Also, keep in mind, that during busy season, we may have to deny your rental requests, if we ever need the inventory for a customer.

**Culture initiatives**

In support of empowering people to show up as their best, we roll out different initiatives that help to reinforce our cultural ideals. You can check out a list of our current culture initiatives [here](https://docs.google.com/a/theblacktux.com/document/d/1WsGpyiGWMF71KqwpSVu2rXQT--crjVZ--GBzclX_Mp8/edit?usp=sharing)

**Trainings and classes**
 
We encourage people to form groups and take online courses, trainings, or read books on something that they’d like to learn together. Learning with your team members will help motivate you and to provide alternative viewpoints on the subject manner. It also can be a great way to bond with your colleagues.
 
Groups with more than 3 people will be required to host trainings and to give a talk about the new skills you’ve learned. This is not meant to test course completion. This process is informal and meant to encourage knowledge sharing and keep everyone curious and constantly learning new topics.  

Connect with your team about the courses you'd like to take. If there's joint interest in a course, and it's affordable, connect with your manager about it to see if TBT can help cover the cost. 

**Dogs**

In an effort to help our team members bring their whole selves to work, we allow well-behaved dogs to join their owners in the Santa Monica office. Just make sure your dog is safe for a work enviornment, they're not left to wander around the office on their own, they're potty trained, and they aren't frequently crying, growling, or barking in the office. 

As a dog owner, you sometimes tune out your own pups noises and personality quarks, but keep in mind that it's not always easy for your team members to do the same. Try putting yourself in someone elses shoes, if your dog is frequently making loud noises, then they might not be the right fit to be in the office. Remain objective and use your best judgement here. Think of it like a crying baby sitting next to you on the airplane. You feel bad for the baby, and for the parent caring for the child, but the loud crying noises and screams in your ear isn't the most relaxing experience for you to listen to on your flight.
