Culture initiatives

In support of empowering people to show up as their best, we roll out different initiatives that help to reinforce our cultural ideals. You can check out a list of our current culture initiatives here: https://docs.google.com/a/theblacktux.com/document/d/1WsGpyiGWMF71KqwpSVu2rXQT--crjVZ--GBzclX_Mp8/edit?usp=sharing 

Flexible work hours
 
We don’t focus on how many extra hours and days you work. We hire everyone to be efficient with their time and get their work done, so that there are no negative impacts on others. We are working here to make the company successful, and we support each other in every obstacle, struggle, and triumph. In times of urgency, you may need to stay late, or work on a weekend day. We take care of our people and will never abuse this, but we expect you to understand that putting in this extra time may be necessary.
 
If you feel you’re more productive working from home every once in awhile, then connect with your manager about making this happen. For anyone who works from home from time to time, we expect you to be extremely responsive, attend all of your scheduled meetings, and be even more productive than you are while at the office. For some of us, WFH may not make us more productive, and we need to admit this to ourselves. Know your limits. 
 
We’re flexible with people taking time off to enjoy life! We take a responsible amount of time off each year to experience new adventures, relax, or spend time with loved ones. Everyone’s reasons for needing time off are their own, we just ask that you let your manager and team members know and get your work covered while you’re out. We use our best judgement to know how much time off is too much time off. We all love our freedom and we never abuse this privilege. 
 
Trainings and classes
 
We encourage people to form groups and take online courses, trainings, or read books on something that they’d like to learn together. Learning with your team members will help motivate you and to provide alternative viewpoints on the subject manner. It also can be a great way to bond with your colleagues.
 
Groups with more than 3 people will be required to host trainings and to give a talk about the new skills you’ve learned. This is not meant to test course completion. This process is informal and meant to encourage knowledge sharing and keep everyone curious and constantly learning new topics.  

Dogs

In an effort to help our team members bring their whole selves to work, we allow well-behaved dogs to join their owners in the office. For more details about this, our doggie owners can check out our Playbook. 

Confronting the brutal facts

We take a stance and action on human rights issues. The events of the world might seem distant, but we have a responsibility to stay educated, informed, curious, and compassionate about what is happening worldwide. In an effort to stay current and active, we have employee-run groups and culture initiatives that focus on environmental issues, human rights, diversity, LGBTQ rights, animal rights, health, immigrant rights, unconscious biases, womens rights and much more.
