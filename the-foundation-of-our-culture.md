The foundation of our culture: What we believe.

We have a few core beliefs that drive the culture of the black tux. These beliefs inform many aspects of our culture, from our perspective on time-off, to the way we submit expenses. These beliefs are important to share, because they explain "why". These beliefs also set us apart from how many other companies operate. Some people don't agree with these statements, and that's completely ok. Any culture with a strong identity will not be for everyone.

Belief #1 - People can be trustworthy. Many people create organizations based on the unconscious assumption that their employees are not trustworthy. This is shown through policy and rules that are restrictive to employees. These organizations are based on layers of top down control and rules. For example, a company decides they need to implement a strict way to regulate and manage their employees vacation time. The unconscious assumption is that their employees do not know how to manage their own time to effectively accomplish their work. Our belief, is that at the core of every human is someone trustworthy, thoughtful, creative, and capable of making important decisions.

Belief #2 - People are more responsible when given freedom and ownership. The result of trust is freedom. When a manager trusts her employee, she does not feel the need to manage all the details of the work she is doing. She gives her the freedom to make decisions and mistakes. To the employee, this gives a sense of ownership and respect. When people feel this sense of ownership, we believe they will hold themselves accountable.

Belief #3 - Emotional intelligence is as important as academeic intelligence. To operate in an environment of radical trust, requires a high level of emotional intelligence. You must notice and understand the ways ego can influence your decisions. You must have the courage and strength to be radically direct with your co-workers, and also be able to accept feedback without taking it personally. You must avoid making assumptions and always practice listening and and having curiosity toward others.

Belief #4 - A strong culture protects what it believes in. One of the roles of every team member is to protect and live by these beliefs. We will treat people with trust, but that does not mean that they will always respond by being responsible. Many people are not developed enough to handle or want this type of freedom and it is our job to recognize that.
