We have a few core beliefs that drive how we work together at the black tux. These beliefs inform many aspects of our culture, from our perspective on time-off, to the way we submit expenses. These beliefs are important to share, because they explain "why". These beliefs also set us apart from how many other companies operate. Some people don't agree with these statements, and that's completely ok. Any culture with a strong identity will not be for everyone.

Belief #1 - **People are trustworthy.** Many people create organizations based on the unconscious assumption that their employees are not trustworthy. This is shown through policy and rules that are restrictive to employees. These organizations are based on layers of top down control and rules. For example, a company decides they need to implement a strict way to regulate and manage their employees vacation time. The unconscious assumption is that their employees do not know how to manage their own time to effectively accomplish their work. Our belief, is that at the core of every human is someone trustworthy, thoughtful, creative, and capable of making important decisions.

Belief #2 - **People are more empowered when given freedom and ownership.** The result of trust is freedom. When a leader trusts thier employee, they don't feel the need to manage all the details of the work the employee is doing. The leader gives them the freedom to make decisions and mistakes. To the employee, this gives a sense of ownership and respect. When people feel this sense of ownership, we believe they are more likely to hold themselves accountable.

Belief #3 - **Emotional intelligence is highly important in the workplace.** To operate in an environment of radical trust requires a high level of emotional intelligence. You must notice and understand the ways ego can influence your decisions. You must have the courage and strength to be radically direct with your co-workers, and also be able to accept feedback without taking it personally. You must avoid making assumptions and always practice listening and and having curiosity toward others. A culture of emotionally intelligent and open people is also a lot more fun.

Belief #4 - **A healthy culture protects what it believes in.** One of the roles of every team member is to protect and live by these beliefs. We will treat people with trust, but that does not mean that they will always respond by being responsible. At the core we believe there is a trustworthy person, but people do not always act from their core. Our goal is to foster an enviornment that encourages our team to do so, but there will be people who will not show the responsibility necessary for an enviornment of freedom. It is our collective job to recognize and act on that.
