**Compensation**

We pay market salary rate (50th percentile) for everyoneâ€™s role and level. We do that because we want to pay fairly, but also want people who are driven by more than money. All full-time employees are given equity in the company.

Our compensation is decoupled from performance reviews, and we use market data to dictate increases, in order to ensure that we pay everyone fairly. 

We pull compensation data from a system called AdvancedHR, which uses public and private compensation data from all major companies in our industry. The data from AdvancedHR is reviewed once per year at the beginning of each calendar year. During this time, we adjust anyone who is being paid under market rate for their role and level. Anyone who was already at market rate is instead considered for an annual cost of living increase.
