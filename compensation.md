**Compensation**

We have two goals when it comes to compensation: pay people as much as possible within the constraints of scaling the business, and pay people equally. 

In general, we think compensation should be more science than art. Wherever possible we use comparative data to remove bias and judgement. That’s also why we decouple compensation from performance reviews—salaries and wages are determined by the experience level and expertise required for a given role in our industry, at our growth stage, and in our market. We reevaluate all of those factors—for both the company and individuals—once a year and make corrections and adjustments accordingly. 

Compensation is also something we care about because it’s one of the best checks on the culture and mission. For every dollar you could be making somewhere else, we need to provide equal or more value to you through the intangible qualities of the business—be it freedom, meaningful work, inspiring leadership, or a path to growth—or through equity, which we give to all full-time employees.
