What if I’m not currently practicing TBTs values? 
As you read through the culture book, you may notice some values, communication styles, or tactics that you’re not currently practicing. That’s okay. You should take the time to adopt these approaches and values. We know you can’t change yourself overnight, but it is possible to grow. It will take practice and a concerted effort to make these new concepts a habit. 

Does everything in the culture book apply to every team in the company?
