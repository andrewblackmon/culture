The foundation of our culture: What we believe.

We have a few core beliefs that drive the culture of the black tux. These beliefs inform many aspects of our culture; from our perspective on time-off to the way we submit expenses. These beliefs are important to share because they explain "why." These things also set us apart from how many other companies operate. Some people don't agree with these statements, and that's completely ok. Any culture with a strong identity will not be for everyone.
