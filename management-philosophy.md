Managing up
 
No one can read your mind. It’s up to you to speak to your manager about your needs. Here are a few examples: if you want more responsibility, you’re running behind on a deadline, you’ve made a mistake, you’re unhappy with communication, you want mentorship, you want to learn a new skill, you need help, you want feedback on what you’re doing well or can improve. These are some of the topics that your manager wants to know about and can help you with.


Office layout 
 
Our office space is an open floor plan. No one has an office. We don’t practice a strict hierarchical structure here. We have a fluid work environment where everyone can approach their colleges to ask questions, voice their ideas, or just stop by to check in and see how their teammate is doing.
