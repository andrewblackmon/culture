Our managers

We have managers at TBT, but in reality everyone self-manages. Employees are able to do this because they care about their work, are experts at their job, know their teammates jobs as well, and are working towards TBTs higher purpose. If one day a manager were to go out on leave, anyone on their team would be able to take over and run the department. 

We have an unofficial hierarchy of credibility, which springs from experience, trust, communication, and a host of other factors. Aspects of work are owned by particular roles. Ownership, is not about exclusively controlling a role, but a privilege and responsibility to serve the company. Certain roles are specific domains, others are shared by many roles within a circle, while others are unassigned, and everyone can impact them together.  

Our managers hire people who are smarter than themselves. They sincerely care about the people who work on their team. They strive to understand who their team members are inside and outside of work, their communication styles, dreams, what makes them happy, and understand their personal preferences. 

They take risks, have a vision and a strategy for the team, and are always looking for new innovative ways to do things within the department. They communicate truthfully even about the most complex situations or issues. They invest time to consistently give their team transparent context about what’s happening within their department and the company. 

If theres a problem we solve it ourselves.


Managing up
 
No one can read your mind. It’s up to you to speak to your manager about your needs. Here are a few examples: if you want more responsibility, you’re running behind on a deadline, you’ve made a mistake, you’re unhappy with communication, you want mentorship, you want to learn a new skill, you need help, you want feedback on what you’re doing well or can improve. These are some of the topics that your manager wants to know about and can help you with.


Office layout 
 
Our office space is an open floor plan. No one has an office. We don’t practice a strict hierarchical structure here. We have a fluid work environment where everyone can approach their colleges to ask questions, voice their ideas, or just stop by to check in and see how their teammate is doing.
