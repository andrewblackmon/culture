Our leaders 

We have leaders at TBT, but in reality everyone self-manages. Employees are able to do this because they care about their work, are experts at their job, know their teammates jobs as well, and are all working towards TBTs higher purpose. If one day a leader were to go out on leave, anyone on their team would be able to take over and run the department. 

We have an unofficial hierarchy of credibility, which springs from experience, trust, communication, and a host of other factors. Aspects of work are owned by particular roles. Ownership, is not about exclusively controlling a role, but a privilege and responsibility to serve the company. Certain roles are specific domains, others are shared by many roles within a circle, while others are unassigned, and we all impact them together.  

Our leaders hire people who are smarter than themselves. They sincerely care about the people who work on their team. They strive to understand who their team members are inside and outside of work, their communication styles, dreams, what makes them happy, and understand their personal preferences. 

They take risks, have a vision and a strategy for the team, and are always looking for new innovative ways to do things within the department. A requirment we have for our leaders is to seek out and instigate change even when things are going well. We believe that if we don't constantly look for ways to evolve that we'll become complacent and won't be able to adapt when a real crisis happens. 

They communicate truthfully even about the most complex situations or issues. They invest time to consistently give their team transparent context about what’s happening within their department and the company. 

If theres a problem we solve it ourselves. Our leaders are fearless, confident and have the ability to problem solve things they've never done before on their own. Whether it's repairing a leaking pipe, hanging a dart board in the office, or figuring out a technical issue. When an issue comes up, we don't hire consultants or outside contractors (unless is absolutely necessary). By requiring our team to problem solve ourselves we get to fully understand the issue, learn from it, and ensure it doesn't happen again. 

Managing up
 
No one can read your mind. It’s up to you to speak to the leader in your department about your needs. Here are a few examples: if you want more responsibility, you’re running behind on a deadline, you’ve made a mistake, you’re unhappy with communication, you want mentorship, you want to learn a new skill, you need help, you want feedback on what you’re doing well or can improve. These are just some of the topics that your manager wants to know about and can help you with, and it's on you to ask. 

Office layout 
 
Our office space is an open floor plan. No one has an office. We don’t practice a strict hierarchical structure here. We have a fluid work environment where everyone can approach their colleges to ask questions, voice their ideas, or just stop by to check in and see how their teammate is doing.
