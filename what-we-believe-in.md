What we believe in

We have a collective purpose. Everything we do is in an effort to help our company grow.

Giving back

We donate all of our retired garments to local schools and nonprofits that support underserved youth. These retired garments are in excellent condition with hardly any noticeable wear and tear. We believe that everyone should look their best regardless of income, whether they're headed to their first job interview, formal event, prom, or wedding.
 
We will volunteer together often. Ideally, we volunteer with different non-profits on a monthly basis. At a minimum, we do it on a quarterly basis. We ask that everyone in the company take the lead in planning a volunteer event at some point during their time with the company. We want everyone to contribute to the culture, choose a non-profit, plan the event, and run with it. 

Not a right fit for the company  

There are of course the obvious ways to be let go (harrassment, intoxication, violence, attendance, illegal activities, failure to do job requirements, etc). One of the easiest ways to get kicked out of TBT, is if you’re making bad decisions without seeking advice from the right people. We don’t keep people with bad judgment. We don’t allow people to abuse TBTs freedoms and perks. We don’t keep people who don’t take initiative, are intolerant of change, abuse company money, show intolerance of others, are inflexible, participate in mean spirited gossip, breach company values, or who constantly negative about the company. We are all responsible for our behaviors and actions, and we have no one to blame but ourselves if we’re not performing.
