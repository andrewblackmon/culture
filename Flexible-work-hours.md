**Flexible work hours**
 
Much of our culture is designed around the premise that happy people are more productive, and that everyone works in their own way. That’s why our policies around work flexibility deserve special mention. 

We don’t care how many hours a week you work, where you get your work done from, and how much time you take off each year provided your choices about each of those things meet the following criteria: 

* You are performing all the responsibilities of your job
* It doesn’t affect anyone else negatively
* Your manager knows about it
* Your choices are in alignment with our values 

Those are big concepts and in some ways the ultimate expression of the culture we want to create: a balance between freedom, accountability, and self-awareness.  

This isn’t new, but we’re doubling down on it. And it’s a risk, because if these policies get abused it means a couple things: we aren’t communicating our values clearly, we’re not upholding them as a community, we’re hiring the wrong people, and/or we’re managing poorly. So we really want this to work. 

Our goal is to measure success by output, not input. Expectations from managers should be clear (if they’re not, ask for clarity). The ability to take an afternoon off to join a last minute hiking trip goes hand in hand with the responsibility to work late on a project with a hard deadline. The ability to work from home occasionally goes hand in hand with the responsibility to attend certain meetings in person or travel for work if your job requires it. 

It’s a balance, and it will be different for all of us—depending on our job functions, personalities, or even California labor laws, the amount of time we spend out of the office, on our own schedules, or on vacation will vary greatly. For some of us, those dependencies will limit flexibility in these areas, and in that case we hope other aspects of the culture make this the place you want to work. 

The bottom line is that we hire people to fit our culture and be excellent at their job. We are flexible with where and when they do this.

**Leaves**

There may come a time when you need to take an extended amount of time off, for a leave of absence. We trust you to use your best judgement and take a leave when you need to. Before taking time off, check the Playbook (posted on BambooHR) to understand if you qualify for a leave, and then connect with the Talent team to discuss the details. 

The Black Tux Child Bonding Pay

If you’re becoming a new mom or dad, you better take some much needed time off to spend time with your family! TBT supports every full-time team member in doing this by allowing you to take up to six (6) weeks of paid time off to bond with your new baby. This means you can take off for the birth, adoption, and/or fostering of your new child.  

You’re not required to take the full six weeks to receive this benefit. We just ask that you take the time off within 12 months from the date of the birth or placement of your child, and that the time off is taken in at least 1 week increments. 

Before you take time off, contact the Talent & People Department to find out the details about the benefits available to you.
