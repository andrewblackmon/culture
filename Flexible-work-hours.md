**Flexible work hours**
 
Much of our culture is designed around the premise that happy people are more productive, and that everyone works in their own way. That’s why our policies around work flexibility deserve special mention. 

We don’t care how many hours a week you work, where you get your work done from, and how much time you take off each year provided your choices about each of those things meet the following criteria: 

* You are performing all the responsibilities of your job
* It doesn’t affect anyone else negatively
* Your manager knows about it
* Your choices are in alignment with our values 

Those are big concepts and in some ways the ultimate expression of the culture we want to create: a balance between freedom, accountability, and self-awareness.  

This isn’t new, but we’re doubling down on it. And it’s a risk, because if these policies get abused it means a couple things: we aren’t communicating our values clearly, we’re not upholding them as a community, we’re hiring the wrong people, and/or we’re managing poorly. So we really want this to work. 

Our goal is to measure success by output, not input. Expectations from managers should be clear (if they’re not, ask for clarity). The ability to take an afternoon off to join a last minute hiking trip goes hand in hand with the responsibility to work late on a project with a hard deadline. The ability to work from home occasionally goes hand in hand with the responsibility to attend certain meetings in person or travel for work if your job requires it. 

It’s a balance, and it will be different for all of us—depending on our job functions, personalities, or even California labor laws, the amount of time we spend out of the office, on our own schedules, or on vacation will vary greatly. For some of us, those dependencies will limit flexibility in these areas, and in that case we hope other aspects of the culture make this the place you want to work. For still others, there may come a time where life circumstances require an extended leave of absence that will come into conflict with your job responsibilities. It is always our goal to be supportive and understanding, and are open to such leaves on a case by case basis.

The bottom line is that we hire people to fit our culture and be excellent at their job. We are flexible with where and when they do this.

**Attendance guidelines**

We view attendance, and showing up to work on time, as an mandatory requirement of everyone's job and a reflection of their overall work performance. As part of our culture of trust, freedom, and accountability, everyone is responsible for showing up to work at the required time.

Every department manages fundamentally different areas of the business, of which have varying job requirements. We can't all have the same flexibilities with our work schedules, and departments with set specific work schedules, need to be at work, clocked in, and ready to work at the start of their scheduled shift. 

Our goal isn't to treat each other unfairly, but we all need to own our individual day-to-day accountabilities, and understand the requirements of our jobs. 

Unplanned absences and lateness have a huge impact on business operations, it affects your teammates, our customers, and the team's overall productivity. If you're unable to attend work due to an extreme and rare circumstance (illness, emergency, or unexpected event that requires you to take time off on short notice), you need to give your direct supervisor a heads up, as soon as possible. This should not be a frequent event, in typical circumstances. 

We want to be as transparent and honest with you about our thoughts on attendance, and if you’re excessively late you will be terminated.
