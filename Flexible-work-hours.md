**Flexible work hours**
 
We don’t focus on how many hours and days you work. We hire everyone to be efficient with their time and get their work done, so that there are no negative impacts on others. We are all working to make the company successful, and we support each other in every obstacle, struggle, and triumph. In times of urgency, you may need to stay late, or work on a weekend day. We take care of our people and will never abuse this, but we expect you to understand that putting in this extra time may be necessary. Accomplishing our mission will sometimes require late nights and going the extra mile - we want a team of people who are excited to do this when necessary, because they understand the impact.

If you feel you’re more productive working from home sometimes, then connect with your manager about making this happen. When you work from home, we expect you to be responsive, attend all of your scheduled meetings, and be as productive as you are while at the office. For some of us, working from home may make us less productive, or not even be a possibility given the nature of our work, and we need to admit this to ourselves. Know your limits, and understand your job responsibilities.

We’re flexible with people taking time off to enjoy life! We take a responsible amount of time off each year to experience new adventures, relax, or spend time with loved ones. Everyone’s reasons for needing time off are their own, we just ask that you let your manager and team members know and get your work covered while you’re out. We use our best judgement to know how much time off is too much time off. We all love our freedom, and we never abuse this privilege. Please check out the Playbook for more details on taking paid time off.

The bottom line is that we hire people to fit our culture and be excellent at their job. We are flexible with where and when they do this.

**Leaves**

There may come a time when you need to take an extended amount of time off for a leave of absence. We trust you to use your best judgement and take a leave when you need to. Before taking off, check the Playbook (posted on BambooHR) to understand if you qualify for a leave, and then connect with the Talent to discuss the details. 

The Black Tux Child Bonding Pay

If you’re becoming a new mom or dad, you better take some much needed time off to spend time with your family! TBT supports every full-time team member in doing this by allowing you to take up to six (6) weeks of paid time off to bond with your new baby. This means you can take off for the birth, adoption, and/or fostering of your new child.  

You’re not required to take the full six weeks to receive this benefit. We just ask that you take the time off within 12 months from the date of the birth or placement of your child, and that the time off is taken in at least 1 week increments. 

Before you take time off, contact the Talent & People Department to find out the details about the benefits available to you.
