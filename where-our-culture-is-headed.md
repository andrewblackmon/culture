**Team organization**

We’re moving towards being an organization that allows everyone in the company to express a higher purpose. Instead of job descriptions, every role has a purpose and accountabilities. An employee’s autonomy is protected and they are given freedom to do anything within the purpose of their role. They remain accountable to their team and the company as a whole. Everyone can take action on their own responsibilities as long as it doesn’t violate another's roles accountabilities.

By outlining everyone’s accountabilities, we allow each team member to be empowered, execute on what we’re great at, avoid bottlenecks from upper management, and work together as a balanced unit where everyone is able to contribute their own specialized knowledge. 

We all collaborate with one another regardless of title. We offer each other suggestions, and ideas, but we don’t over-step regarding other people’s accountabilities. We don’t have independent silos or suspicion between departments. We’re all in this together, and we support each other in our successes and failures.

This approach may be very different from our current practices. To avoid confusion and disruption to the stability of our teams, we’ll be rolling out this new approach to job duties and team structures slowly, department by department.  

To understand more about the origin about our new approach to management and jobs roles, check out this Ted talk by Brian Robertson on *[Holacracy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJxfJGo-vkI). 
 
Keep in mind that we’ll be implementing our own version of a Holacracy-like approach that won’t be the exact same as outlined in this talk.
