**Meetings**

In an effort to encourage a culture of vulnerability, honesty, and productivity in all of our meetings, we’ll be taking a new approach to how we hold meetings. 

We discourage long and unproductive meetings. If you feel like a meeting is necessary, then try to keep it to no more than 30 min. If you’re hosting a meeting, provide an agenda to keep things timely and on track. The purpose of our meeting agendas are to help keep our egos in check, and interact with each other from a place of wholeness during meetings.

In order to allow everyone to participate in meetings from a place of vulnerability and honesty, we start your meetings with a round of check-ins to see how everyone is feeling that day. This allows acknowledgement of unspoken emotions - the excitement, concerns, stress, etc. This practice encourages us to be vulnerable and honest with each other. Here are some examples of how to start check-ins: Share a brief story of someone you recently thanked or congratulated. Share a story of a mistake or mess up you made in or outside of work. Ask everyone to share a joke, or something embarrassing or funny that happened to them recently. Ask fun random questions to get to know each other.

Try to be on time for all meetings. If you’re late for a meeting, notify the meeting host ASAP to let them know. During the meeting, please be engaged and refrain from checking your phone or computer or working on other things not related to the meeting topics. At the conclusion of each meeting, review and assign action items.

**Office layout** 
 
Our office space is an open floor plan. No one has an office. We don’t practice a strict hierarchical structure here. We have a fluid work environment where everyone can approach their colleges to ask questions, voice their ideas, or just stop by to check in and see how their teammate is doing. It is important that we are all mindful of one another as we share a large space, so it's important to be considerate regarding noise, cleanliness, barking dogs, and other unpleasant sounds.

Treat our space as if it were your own home, and help out your coworkers out when they need an extra hand. If there were boxes piling up at your front door at home, you wouldn’t leave them. If you had dirty dishes in your sink, you’d clean them. Likewise at TBT, if there are tasks that need to be done to help out a team member or in our space, chip in and help out.

**Human rights issues**

We take a stance and action on human rights issues. The events of the world might seem distant, but we have a responsibility to stay educated, informed, curious, and compassionate about what is happening worldwide. In an effort to stay current and active, we have employee-run groups and culture initiatives that focus on environmental issues, human rights, diversity, LGBTQ rights, animal rights, health, immigrant rights, unconscious biases, women's rights and much more.

**Work Attire**

We encourage everyone to dress in a way that represents their own unique self. Our work environment is casual, and we allow jeans, t-shirts, and sneakers. Just keep in mind that we’re a professional workplace too, and expect everyone to use their best judgement when choosing what to wear to work. Try to avoid outfits that you'd wear to sleep, the beach, a workout class, while lounging around the house, or in Las Vegas.

For example, don’t wear flip flops, sweat pants, sagging pants, yoga pants, old beat up shoes, see-through clothing, or overly revealing / tight clothing like short shorts, and extra low tops and dresses. 

We want to dress in a way that represents The Black Tux as a casual and stylish, yet professional work environment.
