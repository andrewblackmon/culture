**Communicating with Emotional Intelligence**

We bring our whole authentic selves to work and let everyone contribute in their own unique way. Everyone on the team, including leaders, are encouraged to show up as their whole self and not just bring their “professional’ side to work. This means bringing your fun, weird, caring, authentic, and vulnerable sides to work, and always speaking the truth. By bringing this side of your personality, we believe you will bring more passion, energy, and creativity to your work.
 
We believe in communcating with a high level of self-awareness by monitoring our own emotions, preferences, limitations, strengths, and impulses. We use this information to guide our thinking and actions. We are all equals. We value each other's differences and points of view.

**Altruistic honesty**

We practice candid honesty with each other. Being truthful and straightforward is the only way to know where we stand, what we’re doing well, and what we can improve on. Honesty will ensure the success of our own individual growth and the success of the company. 
 
If we aren’t honest with each other, then we’ll miss out on exchanging great ideas, hearing one anothers’ perspectives, improving ourselves, and understanding on another's needs.

**Feedback and Conflict Resolution**

We focus on self-improvement. We own our viewpoints, thoughts, and actions. We don’t speak about our colleagues without them in the room, or spread ill thoughts about them. Conflicts are handled between those involved, and don’t involve unnecessary parties. Rather than blaming others, we consider how we have contributed to the conflict, and how we might work to improve the situation.

Disagreements can arise from a personal conflicts, job performance, technical decisions, projects, not living by our values, or a variety of other things. Whatever the topic may be, we start by meeting 1:1 with the person, in private, to sort it out. We don’t bring our ego’s to the conversation, and we approach this from a place of compassion and vulnerability. 

During your conversation, we ensure that our feedback is coming from a place of good intentions, and we remain direct and to the point. We start by stating: how we feel, what we need, and then we ask our team member what they need. We stay calm, keep it conversational, and are never accusatory, demeaning, or condescending. 

If you can’t find a resolution after your conversation, then bring in a trusted manager, colleague, or someone from the Talent team as a mediator. If mediation fails, bring in a different topic-relevant colleague or a manager to help shape an agreement. 

At times, conflicts will be very serious in nature and will need outside help from the begining.
