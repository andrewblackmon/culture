Who we hire 

Our employees our motivated by their own drive to produce excellent work and to make the company great. They do not need their hands held by managers, but use their intrinsic skills to achieve greatness. Though they are extraordinary in and outside of work, their egos are kept in check, and they could care less about being in the limelight. 

Learning  
We all make mistakes and work to learn from them. Failures should not be hidden, but discussed as a way for the group to learn how to avoid future pitfalls. Constructive feedback should not be taken as an affront, but as a guide for further personal growth.
 
The key to success is learning from the ups and downs. We share with one another our struggles, failures, and sacrifices as these are the only way to make us stronger, more compassionate, and grateful at everything we do in life.
