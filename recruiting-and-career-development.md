**Career Development**

Your development in your career is based on your own intrinsic motivation, hard work, dedication, and curiosity to learn. We all need to own our own career development, and help ourselves learn new skills that we find interesting. 

No company will ever have enough growth or upward mobility opportunities for everyone on the team. In these cases, we celebrate when someone on the team leaves for a bigger job that we didn’t have available to offer them internally. We genuinely care about our team members and want the best for them whether it’s at TBT or somewhere else. 

You can find a list of suggestions [here](https://docs.google.com/a/theblacktux.com/document/d/12wy_jJs7D6T48x5NMIH_KNDEoglSS7HoLIRhPP8WPb4/edit?usp=sharing) on some ways to manage your career development. 

**Referral Bonuses**

We pride ourselves on hiring honest, interesting, curious, and emotionally intelligent people. We would like to continue to attract like-minded talent, and to encourage this, we've created a referral policy where we cover the cost of your round-trip flight to anywhere in the world for you and a +1 when you refer a friend who's hired by TBT for a full-time technical or manager level role.

We offer different types of referral bonuses for customer care, warehouse floor temps, and intern roles as well.

Check out the Playbook for more details.
