**Career Development**

Your development in your career is based on your own intrinsic motivation, hard work, dedication, and curiosity to learn. We all need to own our own career development, and help ourselves learn new skills that we find interesting. 

No company will ever have enough growth or upward mobility opportunities for everyone on the team. In which case, we celebrate when someone on the team leaves for a bigger job that we didn’t have available to offer them internally. We genuinely care about our team members and want the best for them whether it’s at TBT or somewhere else. 

You can find a list of suggestions [here](https://docs.google.com/a/theblacktux.com/document/d/12wy_jJs7D6T48x5NMIH_KNDEoglSS7HoLIRhPP8WPb4/edit?usp=sharing) on some ways to manage your own career development. 

**Referral Bonuses**

We pride ourselves on hiring smart, adventurous, and passionate people, and we would like to continue to attract like-minded talent. To encourage referrals, we offer an employee referral program.

Here’s how it works: 
 
* The Black Tux will cover the cost of a round-trip flight anywhere in the world with the successful placement of a referred full-time employee.

* Total trip value cannot exceed $5,000 for all technical roles (engineering and QA), and/or $2,000 for all non-technical roles (manager level and above)

* The referral bonus can be used after the new employee has completed their 90th day of employment

* Internships and contractor positions are not eligible

* Flights must be booked through the company Amex account. Please work with the Talent team to book your flight

* When you’re ready to use your referral bonus, you’ll need to provide the Talent team with at least one (1) month advance notice before the trip

* Flights must be used within one (1) year of earning the bonus

Customer care full-time referrals
