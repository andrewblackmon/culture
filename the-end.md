As you read through the culture book, you may have encountered information that’s new and different, and it may have brought up questions for you about values, emotional intelligence practices, communication styles, or tactics that you’re not currently practicing. That’s okay! Our culture is only going to be cohesive if we all work together and constantly reinforce it by living by our company's values and practices. We ask that everyone on the team be flexible, patient, open minded, and have a willingness to want to improve themselves. We will provide you with the support and guidance you need by giving you ongoing transparent and honest feedback about where you stand. We know you can’t change yourself overnight, but it is possible to grow. It will take practice and a concerted effort to make these new concepts a habit.
