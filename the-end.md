As you read through the culture book, you may notice some values, emotional intelligence practices, communication styles, or tactics that you’re not currently practicing. That’s okay, none of us are perfect. These are guiding principles that we’re all working towards, and we’ll provide you the support and guidance you need to get where you need to be. We will be giving you ongoing transparent and honest feedback about where you stand. However, we can’t help you if you’re unwilling to want to improve yourself. You should take the time to adopt these approaches and values on your own as well. We know you can’t change yourself overnight, but it is possible to grow. It will take practice and a concerted effort to make these new concepts a habit.
