Freedom and ownership 

We have an understanding that as you’re given more freedom, you remain equally accountable for your actions.

In support of our culture of trust, and in order for us all to make the best possible decisions for the company, we share sensitive and unfiltered information with everyone in the company. We can all view each other’s expense reports, budgets, and KPIs. We trust everyone to deal with and be in support of the good and bad news. When we have questions or concerns about the data and information being shared, we ask the  accountable experts in the company to avoid misinterpretation and distortion of information. 

Our culture is not built on fear or suspicion, so there is no need to hide any “bad results” from one another. We all make mistakes, and we expect everyone to own up to these mistakes and find solutions to improve the situation. This approach forces us to grow and face  realty. 

Purpose and Strategy

We view the organization as a living system where we’re all working towards a higher purpose of helping people show up as their best. We believe in a sensing and responding approach rather than predicting and controlling method across all departments. We don’t believe in having strict long-term plans, targets, or budgets. Our strategy is to have a clear intent for where we’re going with an outline of guidelines of how we’ll get there. We believe that if we plan too much for the future, then we stop paying attention to reality of what is actually happening. 

We’ve let go of the illusion of control. Instead, we’ve established a loose strategy that can be implemented quickly and improved at any point. By making fast iterations, we will progress much faster and smoothly toward our purpose. No energy is wasted predicting the supposedly best decision.

Budgets and Expenses

Our budgets are created to help guide us to where we want to go, but we can’t predict the future, and we constantly listen and adjust our budgets as strategies evolve. Our teams make rough quarterly predictions for the year and include expenses of large purchases such as softwares, materials, contracts, building leases, etc in their budgets. These budgets are used as an outline and can be improved at any point. When budgets are created and updated, we seek consultation and input from our team members who are impacted by these decisions. 

To streamline our employee reimbursement process, we use Expensify to submit our company related expenses for reimbursement once a month. All expenses and receipts must be attached to expense reports. We ask that all expenses be submitted within 60 days of the expense. After your report is submitted, you will receive a direct deposit within 7-10 business days. 

In support of our culture of trust, we do not require approval of company related expenses. We expect everyone on the team to have good judgement and understand what expenses are reasonable and reimbursable. In addition, to foster more transparency of company related expenses, we make all expense reports open and viewable for anyone in the company to see.  

Compensation

We pay market salary rate (50th percentile) for everyone’s role and level. Our compensation is decoupled from performance reviews, and we use market data to dictate increases, in order to ensure that we pay everyone fairly. 

We pull compensation data from a system called AdvancedHR, which uses public and private compensation data from all major companies in our industry. The data from AdvancedHR is reviewed once per year at the beginning of each calendar year. During this time, we adjust anyone who is being paid under market rate for their role and level. Anyone who was already at market rate is instead considered for an annual cost of living increase.

Job Descriptions

Everyone in the company works towards expressing a higher purpose. Instead of job descriptions, every role has a purpose and accountabilities. An employee’s autonomy is protected and they are given freedom to do anything within the purpose of their role. They remain accountable to their team and the company as a whole. Everyone can take action on their own responsibilities as long as it doesn’t violate another's roles accountabilities.

Meetings

We discourage long and unproductive meetings. If you feel like a meeting is necessary, then try to keep it to no more than 30 min. If you’re hosting a meeting, provide an agenda to keep things timely and on track. The purpose of our meeting agendas are to help keep our egos in check, and interact with each other from a place of wholeness during meetings. 

Start your meetings with a round of check-ins to see how everyone is feeling that day. This allows acknowledgement of unspoken emotions - the excitement, concerns, stress, etc. This practice encourages us to be vulnerable and honest with each other. Below are some examples of how to start check-ins: 
Share a brief story of someone you recently thanked or congratulated. 
Share a story of a mistake or mess up you made in or outside of work. 
Ask everyone to share a joke, or something embarrassing or funny that happened to them recently. 
Ask fun random questions to get to know each other. 

Try to be on time for all meetings. If you’re late for a meeting, notify the meeting host ASAP to let them know. During the meeting, please be engaged and refrain from checking your phone or computer or working on other things not related to the meeting topics. At the conclusion of each meeting, review and assign action items. 

Office layout 

Our office space is an open floor plan. No one has an office. We don’t practice a strict hierarchical structure here. We have a fluid work environment where everyone can approach their colleges to ask questions, voice their ideas, or just stop by to check in and see how their teammate is doing. 

Hours in the office 

We don’t focus on how many extra hours and days you work. We hire everyone to be efficient with their time and get their work done, so that there are no negative impacts on others. We are working here to make the company successful, and we support each other in every obstacle, struggle, and triumph. In times of urgency, you may need to stay late, or work on a weekend day. We take care of our people and will never abuse this, but we expect you to understand that putting in this extra time may be necessary.

WFH

If you feel you’re more productive working from home every once in awhile, then connect with your manager about making this happen. For anyone who works from home from time to time, we expect you to be extremely responsive, attend all of your scheduled meetings, and be even more productive than you are while at the office. For some of us, WFH may not make us more productive, and we need to admit this to ourselves. Know your limits. 

Open PTO

We’re flexible with people taking time off to enjoy life! We take a responsible amount of time off each year to experience new adventures, relax, or spend time with loved ones. Everyone’s reasons for needing time off are their own, we just ask that you let your manager and team members know and get your work covered while you’re out. We use our best judgement to know how much time off is too much time off. We all love our freedom and we never abuse this privilege.
