People are trustworthy.

We operate on trust rather than fear. Our default is to trust our co-workers until proven wrong.

Purpose and Strategy

We view the organization as a living system where we’re all working towards a higher purpose of helping people show up as their best. We believe in a sensing and responding approach rather than predicting and controlling method across all departments. We don’t believe in having strict long-term plans, targets, or budgets. Our strategy is to have a clear intent for where we’re going with an outline of guidelines of how we’ll get there. We believe that if we plan too much for the future, then we stop paying attention to reality of what is actually happening.By making fast iterations, we will progress much faster and smoothly toward our purpose. 

Decision-Making

Every action and decision we make has a direct effect on our culture and our success. We encourage everyone on the team to share their opinions and help make decisions for the company, but this must be done under two conditions: 1.) you seek consultation from experts of the topic, and 2.) you get input from the people who are impacted by the decision. We believe that people are smarter when they use their collective intelligence to make decisions. Not all advice must be consensus, but the needs of others must be considered.

Provide alternative solutions

We share our ideas about how to make things better. Everyone at every level is curious, asks questions, and has alternative solutions and suggestions that they share with their team members. We do this in a constructive, non emotional, and not hurtful way, and we know our limits. We do this to make us better.
 
We never put each other down, or complain without providing an alternative solution. Complaining just to complain is unhelpful, unproductive, and solves nothing.

Responsibility and accountability

Our duty extends beyond our own roles to how our actions can benefit the company as a whole. If others are not upholding their roles, we need to respectfully encourage them to continue to work for the collective benefit.
