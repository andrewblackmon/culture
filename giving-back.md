**Giving back**

We donate all of our retired garments to local schools and nonprofits that support underserved youth. These retired garments are in excellent condition with hardly any noticeable wear and tear. We believe that everyone should look their best regardless of income, whether they're headed to their first job interview, formal event, prom, or wedding.
 
We will volunteer together often. Ideally, we volunteer with different non-profits on a monthly basis. At a minimum, we do it on a quarterly basis. We ask that everyone in the company take the lead in planning a volunteer event at some point during their time with the company. We want everyone to contribute to the culture, choose a non-profit, plan the event, and run with it.
