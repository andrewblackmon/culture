Our Purpose is to give people confidence for life's most important moments.

The story is  simple. Andrew and Pat needed to rent a tux for Andrew's wedding in 2013. The only options to do so were inconveneint, low quality, and from brands that they did not connect with. Come wedding day, they both looked and felt terrible. They decided that people should not feel this way, especially on biggest days of their lives. 


Our Vision is to transform the entire experience by...

1. Elevating the style and fit of rental garments
2. Creating a modern convenient user experience
3. Providing concierge like personal service
4. Empowering customers through meaningful content
5. Creating a trusted and socially relevant brand


Our Mission (in the short term) is to bring this experience to as many customers as possible, making us the most recognizable (and loved) suit & tuxedo rental brand.

In the long term, our mission is expand from rentals to all of formalwear (rental & sales) making us the most recognizable (and loved) formalwear brand.
