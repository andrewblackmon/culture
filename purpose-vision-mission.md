**Our Purpose** is to give people confidence for life's most important moments.

The story is simple. Andrew and Pat needed to rent tuxedos for Andrew's wedding in 2013. The only options to do so were inconvenient, low quality, and from brands that they did not connect with. Come wedding day, they both looked and felt terrible. They decided that people should not feel this way, especially on the biggest days of their lives.

**Our Vision** is to transform the entire experience by...

1. Elevating the style and fit of rental garments - We believe incredible fit and timeless style should be accessible.
2. Creating a modern convenient user experience - We believe we can create an online experience that meets or exceeds peoples' expectations of a traditional in-store experience.
3. Providing concierge like personal service - We believe the importance of life's biggest moments deserve extraordinary personal service.
4. Empowering customers through meaningful content - We believe knowledge builds confidence to transform people into the best version of themselves.
5. Creating a trusted and socially relevant brand - We believe we have the opportunity and responsibilty to engage with our comminuty in a meaningful way.


**Our Mission** is to be the globally recognized leader in men's formalwear.
