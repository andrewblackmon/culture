Given the nature of our business, we have a variety of different roles within the company from dry cleaning, to engineering, to customer care, to retail, and much more. Every department manages fundamentally different areas of the business that all have varying job requirements. We can't all have the same flexibilities with our work schedules, perks, work practices, or even attend every work sponsored event. Our goal isn't to exclude anyone, but we all need to own our own individual domains and day-to-day accountabilities, and understand what things we can and cannot participate in.
