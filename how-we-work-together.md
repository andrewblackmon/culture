Freedom and ownership 

We have an understanding that as you’re given more freedom, you remain equally accountable for your actions.

In support of our culture of trust, and in order for us all to make the best possible decisions for the company, we share sensitive and unfiltered information with everyone in the company. We can all view each other’s expense reports, budgets, and KPIs. We trust everyone to deal with and be in support of the good and bad news. When we have questions or concerns about the data and information being shared, we ask the  accountable experts in the company to avoid misinterpretation and distortion of information. 

Our culture is not built on fear or suspicion, so there is no need to hide any “bad results” from one another. We all make mistakes, and we expect everyone to own up to these mistakes and find solutions to improve the situation. This approach forces us to grow and face  reality. 

Job Descriptions

Everyone in the company works towards expressing a higher purpose. Instead of job descriptions, every role has a purpose and accountabilities. An employee’s autonomy is protected and they are given freedom to do anything within the purpose of their role. They remain accountable to their team and the company as a whole. Everyone can take action on their own responsibilities as long as it doesn’t violate another's roles accountabilities.

We all collaborate with one another regardless of title. We offer each other suggestions, and ideas, but we don’t over-step regarding other people’s accountabilities. We don’t have independent silos or suspicion between departments. We’re all in this together, and we support each other in our successes and failures.

Meetings

We discourage long and unproductive meetings. If you feel like a meeting is necessary, then try to keep it to no more than 30 min. If you’re hosting a meeting, provide an agenda to keep things timely and on track. The purpose of our meeting agendas are to help keep our egos in check, and interact with each other from a place of wholeness during meetings. 

Start your meetings with a round of check-ins to see how everyone is feeling that day. This allows acknowledgement of unspoken emotions - the excitement, concerns, stress, etc. This practice encourages us to be vulnerable and honest with each other. Below are some examples of how to start check-ins: 
Share a brief story of someone you recently thanked or congratulated. 
Share a story of a mistake or mess up you made in or outside of work. 
Ask everyone to share a joke, or something embarrassing or funny that happened to them recently. 
Ask fun random questions to get to know each other. 

Try to be on time for all meetings. If you’re late for a meeting, notify the meeting host ASAP to let them know. During the meeting, please be engaged and refrain from checking your phone or computer or working on other things not related to the meeting topics. At the conclusion of each meeting, review and assign action items.
